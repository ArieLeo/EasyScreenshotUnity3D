Easy ScreenShot - Unity Script
===================

This script was developed to easily create screenshots for the AppStore (according to apple's size guidelines). It will also help you create your android and desktop screenshots.

If every option is selected, the script will create 6 different iOS screenshots (iPhone 3.5, 4, 4.7, 5.5, iPad and iPad Pro), one android screenshot and one desktop screenshot with given size.


How to use?
-------------

* Attach "screenshot.cs" to your main camera.
* Configure the script according to your needs.
* Choose portrait or landscape. On android and desktop you'll have to specify the siz and mode you want.
* If you selected the option to create android or desktop screenshots you can also enlarge your dimensions using the slider.
* Select the screenshot shortcut you'd like to use to create screenshots during runtime.
* Run your game on editor and press your screenshot key.
* The script will save the pictures on a new folder called "screenshots" on your project root.
